    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I am a curious and creative person who loves expressing myself through
      swimming. I value kindness, honesty, and staying true to who I am. At
      school, I try my best to stay focused and help others when I can. In my
      free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, relaxing, or
      exploring new interests. I believe that every day is a chance to learn
      something new, and Iâ€™m excited about what the future holds for me.
